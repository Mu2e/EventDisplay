# Tutorial 3: Adding and Removing Geometries

Follow tutorial 1 or 2.

To remove a geometry object e.g. the CRV or IPA/OPA combo, you can simply look at the drop down "EventScene" menu on the left side.

Find the name of the geometry you want to remove.

Uncheck it. It should disappear. To re-add it simply re-check it.
